# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using machine learning on the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**. The model was developed in **Google Colab** and later tested using **Spyder IDE (via Anaconda Navigator)**.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

- Built a classification model using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.
- Applied **StandardScaler** for feature scaling.
- Evaluated model performance with accuracy scores.
- Allowed real-time prediction using custom input data.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Split into training and testing sets.
3. Scale the features using `StandardScaler`.
4. Train the model using `SVC` (Support Vector Classifier).
5. Evaluate the model's accuracy.
6. Accept user input and predict diabetic status.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction-ml.git

Edit
The person is diabetic ✅
